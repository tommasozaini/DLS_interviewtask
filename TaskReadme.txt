Dear Candidate,

In this folder you find several R scripts, and some scenario data.

TASK 1
------
As a first step, please complete the code in RUNSCRIPT.R.
Your task is to write a few* lines of code that create the output similar to what is in `Data/EXAMPLE EXPECTED OUTPUT`.

After that, your task is to set up some code tests. 
Please try to write at least one test (e.g. unit test or performance test).
It does not have to be perfect, but be prepared to walk us through your thinking during the interview.

For this task, that's all we need. However, if you have time (after also having looked at TASK 2) you're more than welcome to provide more than one test, or show off your Git/GitHub skills by creating a repository or even setting up a CI/CD workflow.


* this should be less than 20 lines


TASK 2
------
Calculate the 'energy needs gap': how much energy would be required to lift everyone up to at minimum DLE levels (i.e., `dle.threshold.adjusted`)?

You may also visualise the numbers. For instance, show how the global 'energy needs gap' is different between scenarios, over time.

You may also refer to http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.27951.14241, if this is helpful. Note that the numbers for this exercise are different from those in the preprint. 

Again, it does not have to be perfect, and if you do not manage all before the interview, that is OK. 

But we will then ask you how you would plan to solve it.


----

Good luck! 

P.S. while we hope that the exercise is sensible - if anything is unclear or seems wrong, feel free to email kikstra@iiasa.ac.at
